# Fishbait

A tool for running commands in response to (github) webhook calls. ðŸŽ£

## Motivation

So I orginally had this idea and right before starting to build, I found [webhook](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook). I starred the repo, and started playing with it, but I found it to be [more powerful than I what I actually wanted/needed](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook/blob/master/docs/Hook-Examples.md). Though I highly reccomend you check it out if you need a lot of configuration, the developer is an awesome person! And, I actually tried out a trial of their service [hookdo](https://www.hookdoo.com/), and it was great, but still a little more than I needed.

Then, I found [node-github-hook](https://github.com/nlf/node-github-hook). It was exactly what I wanted! But after individually setting up 10 different side project repos, decided I needed a single place to manage all my hook deployments.

Thus, back to fishbait I have come, and here I am! This may at some point become it's own CLI tool. But for now is a personal tool that can be moved out later if I find the time :)
